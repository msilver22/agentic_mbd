# ü§ñ AI Agents for Feed Building & Social Prompting 

This project showcases several AI agents built using [*LangGraph*](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and [*Groq Inference*](https://groq.com/), designed to enhance interaction with the Farcaster decentralized social network. These agents leverage the powerful [*mbd*](https://www.mbd.xyz/) API to enable dynamic feed building and social prompting.

## üîß Building blocks
Using structured LangGraph workflows, we implement the two following agents.
Both agents maintain a contextual memory summary of the conversation, allowing them to interpret ambiguous user inputs, remember past user preferences throughout the session and reduce token usage.
All results are returned in a human-readable Markdown format.

### 1 ‚Äì Feed Builder
Retrieve content from Farcaster network.
It can use several tools, including:
- Personalized feed (based on user ID)
- Trending casts
- Popular casts
- Semantic casts (based on user query)

### 2 ‚Äì Social Prompter
Discover relevant people in the Farcaster network.
It can use several tools, including:
- Similar users (based on user ID)
- Semantic users (based on user query)
- Suggested users (based on user ID)

## ü§ñ MBD Agent: Combining Feed Building and Social Prompting

This agent combines three distinct functionalities using a unified LangGraph architecture:
1. **Feed Builder**
2. **Social Prompter** 
3. **Small Talk** : Engages in general conversation when the user is making casual inquiries.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Graph Design

The agent evaluates user input and decides which action to take based on the user's query.

The **planner node** helps determine whether to:
- Trigger the feed-builder node (for querying Farcaster content),
- Activate the social-prompter node (to suggest users), or
- Engage the small-talk node (for conversational interaction).
