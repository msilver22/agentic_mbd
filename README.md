# ü§ñ AI Agents for Feed Building & Social Prompting 

## ü§ñ MBD Agent for Feed Building

This project showcases several AI agents built using [*LangGraph*](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and [*Groq Inference*](https://groq.com/), designed to enhance interaction with the Farcaster decentralized social network. These agents leverage the powerful [*mbd*](https://www.mbd.xyz/) API to enable dynamic feed building and social prompting.

### üîß Building blocks
Using structured LangGraph workflows, we implement the two following agents.
Both agents maintain a contextual memory summary of the conversation, allowing them to interpret ambiguous user inputs, remember past user preferences throughout the session and reduce token usage.
All results are returned in a human-readable Markdown format.

### 1 ‚Äì Feed Builder
Retrieve content from Farcaster network.
It can use several tools, including:
- Personalized feed (based on user ID)
- Trending casts
- Popular casts
- Semantic casts (based on user query)

### 2 ‚Äì Discover New Users
Discover relevant people in the Farcaster network.
It can use several tools, including:
- Similar users (based on user ID)
- Semantic users (based on user query)
- Suggested users (based on user ID)

This agent combines three distinct functionalities using a unified LangGraph architecture:
1. **Feed Builder**
2. **New Users** 
3. **Small Talk** : Engages in general conversation when the user is making casual inquiries.

The agent evaluates user input and decides which action to take based on the user's query.

The **planner node** helps determine whether to:
- Trigger the feed-builder node (for querying Farcaster content),
- Activate the new-user node (to suggest users), or
- Engage the small-talk node (for conversational interaction).

## ü§ñ MBD Agent for Social Prompting

### üîß Building blocks
Using structured LangGraph workflows, we implement the two following agents: one reads the recent activity of the user, and based on that extrapolate keywords and topics to do recommendation; the other is an icebreaker bot that is activated when the user's profile is quite inactive, so the bot tries to capture user's interests trough a multi-turn conversation.

# üöÄ Reproducibility and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/msilver22/agentic_mbd.git
cd agentic_mbd
```

2. **Set Up Docker Environment**

Make sure to run the repository within a Docker container. 

3. **Install Python Dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Set up the API keys**

Make sure to set the API keys into `.env`file. It's needed:
- [*Groq*](https://console.groq.com/dashboard/limits) API key
- [*mbd*](https://docs.mbd.xyz/reference/intro/getting-started) API key
- [*Langfuse*](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) public/private key (optional for tracking)
   
5. **Explore the Agents**
   
The repository is organized as follows:
- `src/` : This folder contains the core implementation of the agents. You can explore the code here to modify or test the underlying models and functionalities.

- `streamlit/` : This folder contains the Streamlit-based UI for the agents. Each agent is designed to be easily interactable through the web interface provided by [*Streamlit*](https://streamlit.io/).

6. **Running the Agents with Streamlit UI**
   
To run any of the agents with the Streamlit UI, navigate to the streamlit directory.
```
cd streamlit
```
Run the desired agent using Streamlit.

```
streamlit run agent_name.py
```
Replace agent_name.py with the appropriate script name for the agent you want to run (e.g., `feed_builder.py`, `social_prompter.py`, `mbd_agent.py`).

The agent will open in your web browser, where you can interact with it via the UI.
